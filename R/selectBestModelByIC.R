#' Information criterion-based multiscale model selection
#'
#' Selects the best model given a vector of AIC/AICc/BIC values for each model under consideration
#'
#' @param IC a numeric vector of AIC, AICc, or BIC values for each model
#' @param tolerance a very small positive scalar accounting for machine precision and roundoff errors in the optimization.
#' The simplest model within tolerance of the minimum IC value is selected as the best model.
#'
#' @return the index (in the IC vector) of the selected model, unless two equally simple models could be selected, then NA
