\usage{
FitAdditiveModel(spikes, f.hat, w0.hat, setup.pars, terminal.points, ct)
}
\arguments{
\item{spikes}{a lits of spike trains}

\item{f.hat}{a numeric vector containing frequency estimates for a particular model}

\item{w0.hat}{a matrix containing phase estimates for each spike train for a particular model}

\item{setup.pars}{a list of additional parameters for the likelihood function, computed by the \code{SetupLikelihoods} function}

\item{terminal.points}{a numeric vector containing the time points at which c(t) changes}

\item{ct}{a numeric vector containing the estimated piecewise constant intensity function c(t). The length of ct should be a whole number power of 2.}
}
\value{
a list of length 3
The first item in the list is a matrix whose rows each containi the MLEs of eta for a single spike train
The second item in the list is a matrix whose rows each contain the MLEs of gamma for a single spike train
The third item in the list is a matrix whose rows each contain the AIC, AICc, BIC, and log-likelihood for the model for a single spike train
